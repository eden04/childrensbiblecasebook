          <h2 style="color:#cd044a">Climate Change</h2> 
          <p>Climate change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. This could be a change in how much rain a place can get in a year. It could also be a change in the usual temperature for a month or season. Climate change is also a change in the earth's climate, so the change in earth’s temperature could be one of the main causes in climate change. The climate of the earth is always changing, and there have been times when the earth's climate has been warmer than it is now, as well as times when it has been cooler.  Many things can cause climate change all on their own: the distance of the sun could change, the sun could send out more or less energy, oceans can change, and even a volcano erupting can change the climate. Most important, however, is that many scientists have discovered that humans are also a major cause of climate change, polluting the environment and destroying ecosystems. Scientists believe that the earth's temperature will continue to go up in the next 100 years, which could in turn cause polar ice to melt and oceans to rise. This can result in major natural disasters and increased refugee crises around the globe</p>

    <div class="textright"><p>The woods and beach surrounding the Great House at the beginning of the novel evoke the Garden of Eden. The opening line of the novel -- "once we lived in a Summer country" -- and the way Eve describes the area are often Edenic: pure, untouched, etc. <br><i>The Garden of Eden, courtesy of The Wellcome Library, London.</i></p></div>

        <div class="textleft"> <p>The general (and some specific) decadence of the parents evokes the "sin" that was rampant in the world before God sent hte Flood to "reset" humanity; it also evokes later biblical references like Sodom &amp;Gomorrah, which receive God's wrath as a result of "sin" and misbehavior.<br> <i>Noah's Ark Ship Animals, from Pixabay. </i></p></div> <br>

        <div class="textleft" style="width:70%"> <p>The name of the yacht is the Cobra, which might be a reference to the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The episode with the yacht kids is when Eve tells Jack about hte climate crisis, paralleling the knowledge of good/evil that comes from the serpent temping Eve and Adam to eat the forbidden fruit. Also, in the bible, one of the first things that Adam &amp; Eve become aware of after eating the fruit is their own nudity; on the beach, Jack sees Alycia nearly naked and comments on it, evoking a parallel. It marks a fall from innocence.<br><i>In the Garden of Eden, courtesy of Wikimedia Commons</i></p></div> <br>

    <div class="textright"><p>The flood in the novel evokes The Flood in the bible, and Jack and Shel collecting animals references the story of Noah (and is directly inspired by it, because Jack got the idea from his Children’s Bible). Similarly, they come to refer to the tree house as the Ark. <br><i>Photo courtesy of Pixabay.</i></p></div>

    <div class="textright"><p>Burl is a man discovered among the reeds, similar to Moses in the bible. This parallel fits in a ton of ways: the story of the Burning Bush is evoked on p. 85, when Burl “learns” that he must lead the children away from the area and he foresees the coming of the plague. When he leads the children out of captivity by their parents (ala the children of Israel out of Egypt), they are pursued by the parents and Burl parts the Red Sea (p. 91).<br><i>The Finding of Moses, courtesy of Picryl.</i></p></div>

    <div class="textright"><p>Continuing on the parallels with Moses, when the group’s original plans are foiled, Burl says he knows a place and leads them to the “perfect” farm -- similar to the Promised Land to which Moses led the children of Israel; once they are there, Burl then “goes up the hill” and talks to the Owner and brings back “the rules.” This directly references Moses climbing Mt. Sinai, talking to God, and coming back with the Ten Commandments (101-103). Many of the rules in the novel directly reference specific Commandments, as well.<br><i>Moses Receiving the Law, courtesy of Picryl.</i></p></div>
          </div>
          
          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Chapter 6</button>
<div class="content">
         <div class="textright" style="width:100%"><p>The arrival of the “trail angels” evokes both the arrival of the Magi (or wise men), as well as perhaps the actual angels who announced Jesus’ birth. Later, the specific angels might also equate to certain apostles -- Luke (Luca), Mattie (Matthew), John. Parallels for Darla remain uncertain.</p></div>
          <div class="textleft" style="width:100%"> <p>When Sukey’s mom gives birth in the barn, it parallels the birth of Jesus in the manger. This reference might also be carried through to the idea that the baby “has no father” (since he left); OR that the baby is then taken in by Sukey who could be seen then as a “virgin Mother.” This then evokes Mary (also referenced when Darla sings the Ave Maria at Sukey’s mom’s funeral).</p></div>
    <img src="images/9_The_plague_Dengue_in_1348__Wellcome_L0072143.jpg" alt="Noah's ark" style="width: 35%;float:left;margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom:10px">
    <div class="textright"><p>The Dengue fever in the book represents the coming of the plague.<br><i>The Plague of Florence in 1348, courtesy of the Wellcome Library, London.</i></p></div>
     <div class="textleft" style="width:100%"> <p>Mattie, of course, also represents Jesus in many ways: he is described as having smooth, olive skin; he teaches biology/science, which in Jack’s new vision equates to Jesus; when he does so, the description of the Kids listening to him uses terms like “faithful,” “devoted,” and “disciples” (p.136-7); he is literally “crucified” when the Governor nails/staples his hands to the bench, as well as when he is tied to the tree; there’s also a reference to him having scars on his foot from stepping on a bottle, referencing the stigmata; when Eve daydreams about untying him from the tree, it is evocative of taking Jesus down from the cross in the bible (p. 170).</p></div>
          </div>
          
          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Chapter 7</button>
<div class="content">
    <div class="textright" style="width:100%"><p>Jack’s “decoding” of the bible is a re-imagining of the Trinity, with God as Nature, Jesus as Science, and the Holy Ghost as art. He also draws direct parallels to many of the miracles of Jesus on p. 144.</p></div>
          <div class="textleft" style="width:100%"> <p>The Governor and his militia reference Pontius Pilate and the Roman soldiers. The Governor tortures Mattie just as Pontius tortured Jesus, and he “washes his hands” of this crime again and again by warning the kids and Burl that it’s their fault for not cooperating.</p></div>
    <div class="textright" style="width:100%"><p>The scene when the other angels are trapped with Mattie behind barbed wire evokes both the crown of thorns and the spear in the side during the trials and crucifixion of Jesus. The circle of barbed wire leads to Darla cutting her forehead, and the constant prodding with the cattle prod is similar to the spear.</p></div>
          <div class="textleft" style="width:100%"> <p>Jack also comes to represent a Jesus figure, or at least a kind of new prophet or Messiah. He says he would rather sacrifice himself than a goat (p. 162); he dispenses more and more wisdom as the novel goes along, becoming a kind of spiritual leader to the group; many of the older kids often agree with and “follow” him (especially w/ Red on p. 180ish); also, ultimately, the novel itself might be seen as Eve’s new bible, sharing the “teachings” of Jack.</p></div>
    <div class="textright" style="width:100%"><p>Red can be seen as a new disciple or convert, as he comes around to the kids’ side, particularly through Jack’s kindness and care. Red can be seen as a Paul figure, as he is converted from originally persecuting the kids (as Paul/Saul did Christians) to a follower; also, he “sees the light” in the middle of the path, as Paul did in the middle of the road to Damascus. Red might also be seen as a Peter figure, as the Owner leaves him in charge of the farm and gives him the (biometric) key to the place; this is like when Peter, one of the earliest major converts to Jesus other than the original apostles, was given the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p></div>
          </div>
          
          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Chapter 8</button>
<div class="content">
    <div class="textright" style="width:100%"><p>The Owner comes to represent God, and particularly the Old Testament God, known for vengeance and wrath. She descends as a Deus ex Machina in the novel (out of nowhere in a helicopter); she is the one who handed down the commandments; she severely punishes the militia men for “not following the rules”; she knows everything; she apparently heals Red’s leg, and Burl and the angels are “with her” in the end.</p></div>

    <div class="textright" style="width:70%;margin-bottom: 12%"><p>The flashback scene of Eve running away from her parents in the protest can symbolically represent Eve’s pursuit of forbidden knowledge, despite the rules set by her parents (p. 205).<br><i>Eve Taking the Forbidden Fruit, courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.</i></p></div>

    <div class="textright" style="margin-top: 5px;width:60%"><p>In the final scene with Jack, he references the Book of Revelation and asks “what happens at the end.” This represents both the biblical end times described in that book of the bible, but also evokes the Second Coming, in which there is an “after,” led by a new version (or return) of Jesus. Again, this might be seen as Jack himself, with his new vision of the Trinity, heaven, etc. (and Eve’s own “bible” about him).<br><i>Eve Photo courtesy of Pixabay.</i></p></div>
